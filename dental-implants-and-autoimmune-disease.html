That means you won't need an extra surgical step.  Because the abutment juts past the gumline, even though, it's visible when you open your mouth — and it'll be that way until your dentist completes the tooth prosthesis.  Some people do not like that appearance and like to have the abutment placed in a separate process. After the abutment is placed, your gums must heal for about two weeks before the artificial tooth can be attached. Choosing your new artificial teethOnce your gums heal, you'll have more impressions product of your mouth and last teeth.  These impressions are used to make the crown — your realistic-searching synthetic tooth.  The crown cannot be placed until your jawbone is powerful enough to support use of the new tooth. You and your dental expert can choose artificial teeth which are removable, fixed or a combination of both:Removable.  This type is similar to a traditional detachable denture and may be a partial or full denture.  It comprises synthetic white teeth surrounded by pink plastic gum. </p>

In some cases, you may wish only minor bone grafting, which are done at an identical time as the implant surgery.  The situation of your jawbone determines how you proceed. Placing the dental implantDuring surgery to put the dental implant, your oral surgeon makes a cut to open your gum and expose the bone.  Holes are drilled into the bone where the dental implant metal post can be placed.  Since the post will serve as the tooth root, it's implanted deep into the bone. At this point, you'll still have a gap where your tooth is lacking.  A type of partial, brief denture can be placed for appearance, if needed.  You can remove this denture for cleansing and when you sleep. Waiting for bone growthOnce the metal implant post is placed to your jawbone, osseointegration (oss-ee-oh-in-tuh-GRAY-shun) begins.  During this method, the jawbone grows into and unites with the floor of the dental implant. </p>
