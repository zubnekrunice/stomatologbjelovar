After the abutment is placed, your gums must heal for approximately two weeks before the synthetic tooth can be attached. Choosing your new artificial teethOnce your gums heal, you'll have more impressions made from your mouth and final teeth.  These impressions are used to make the crown — your realistic-looking synthetic tooth.  The crown cannot be placed until your jawbone is robust enough to help use of the hot tooth. You and your dental professional can choose artificial teeth which are detachable, fixed or a combination of both:Removable.  This type is comparable to a traditional detachable denture and might be a partial or full denture.  It includes synthetic white teeth surrounded by pink plastic gum.  It's fixed on a metal frame that's attached to the implant abutment, and it snaps securely into place.  It can be easily got rid of for repair or daily cleaning. Fixed. </p>
